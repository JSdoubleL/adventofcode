# Advent of Code 

My solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). Year 2023 is done in Python.

Benchmarks can be run with the following command. The `-t` argument runs on test data (instead of input data which is not included in this repo).
```bash
python run_aoc_2023.py -t
```
The solutions to the problems are usually just whatever I wrote at 2 AM or so, when the question was released, and the quality of the code reflects that.
